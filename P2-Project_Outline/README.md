## Submission Instructions

### Overview
In the past month, my dad and I have lamented on how Covid 19 wedged itself between us and our cardgame-loving family. Our favorite game to play is 3 To 13, so I've decided to make an online application to fix that problem. Users will be able to log into the website and make an account for playing 3 to 13, after which they can create a server and invite friends to a game. That way you won't have to drive up to Wisconsin to get your cardgame fix!
